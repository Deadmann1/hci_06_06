Negative Findings (Problems)
-----------------

o MM-PC-Neg01    

  Title:  Inconsistent backwards navigation

  Description:
  
  Search filters are not applied after going backwards
  in the menu structure. The filters are still filled in correctly,
  but the search results disregard them.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg01-backnav-filter.mp4

  Heuristic:  A03 Reversible Actions

  How Reproducible?:
  Congress -> VENUE FINDER AGENCIES & CATERING 
    -> select filter
    -> select item from results
    -> go back (browser back action, or back button doesn't matter)
    -> filter settings are still filled in, 
        but not applied to the results. After clicking 
        search again, the filters are applied correctly.


o MM-PC-Neg02

  Title:  Inconsistent button placement

  Description:
  
  The search button was previously centered, and is now 
  aligned to the right. The filter menus in general seem
  to behave differently at times,
  even though they all look the same.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg02-inconsistent-placement.mp4

  Heuristic:  A04 Consistency

  How Reproducible?:
    Congress -> VENUE FINDER AGENCIES & CATERING                                    ... search button centered
    Congress -> VENUE FINDER AGENCIES & CATERING ->[from sub-menu]  EVENT LOCATIONS ... search button right


o MM-PC-Neg03

  Title:  Text out of containing border

  Description:
  
  Text is not contained in outer box, and
  continues over the border.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg03-out-of-bounds.mp4

  Heuristic:  

  How Reproducible?:
    Congress -> VENUE FINDER AGENCIES & CATERING -> show all in the map -> select "CONVENTA VERANSTALTUNGSMANAGEMENT"


o MM-PC-Neg04

  Title:  Form date format not specified

  Description:
  
  The form expects a date as input,
  the format however is not specified. It displays
  a "accepted" checkmark after inputting an integer
  already.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg04-date-format.mp4

  Heuristic:  A06 Recognition Rather Than Recall

  How Reproducible?:
  Congress -> CONGRESS AND EXHIBITION CALENDAR -> Register conference


o MM-PC-Neg05

  Title:  Inconsistent backwards navigation

  Description:
  
  The options for going back to the parent menu
  is not consistent across the side. Placement varies,
  and sometimes there is no option at all.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg05-backnav.mp4

  Heuristic:  A04 Consistency

  How Reproducible?:
  Menus presented in the video, each having a different backwards navigation option
  
  Congress -> DESTINATION GRAZ -> CAPITAL OF CULINARY DELIGHTS
    -> select item from the three listed
    -> back button is embedded in the content space.

  SEE & DO -> SIGHTSEEING -> Top 10 Sights
    -> select item from the sights listed
    -> no back button provided from the side

  SEE & DO -> EVENTS -> TOP EVENTS
    -> select item from the list
    -> back button at the bottom of the page


o MM-PC-Neg06

  Title:  Broken link collection

  Description:
  
  Links redirecting to a side that is not available,
  or that does not display any content.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg06-broken-link-00.mp4
                mm-pc-neg06-broken-link-01.mp4

  Heuristic:  

  How Reproducible?:
  00: TRAVEL & TRANSPORT -> MOBILE IN GRAZ -> Taxi & Delivery services -> link "Hörmann's Stretchlimousinen Kg"
  01: SEE & DO -> SIGHTSEEING -> Museums & galleries -> History Museum -> link "Entrance fees in detail"


o MM-PC-Neg07

  Title:  Missing image

  Description:
  
  Page header doesn't have the background image like
  the previous pages did.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg07-missing-image.mp4

  Heuristic:  A04 Consistency

  How Reproducible?:
  TRAVEL & TRANSPORT -> GETTING HERE -> BY CARAVAN


o MM-PC-Neg08

  Title:  Button inconsistency

  Description:
  
  The more button is used across the side to
  expand a folded paragraph. In this case it is 
  a link redirecting to a new side.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg08-button-inconsistency.mp4

  Heuristic:  A04 Consistency

  How Reproducible?:
  TRAVEL & TRANSPORT -> MOBILE IN GRAZ -> Bus & Tram


o MM-PC-Neg09

  Title:  Redundant information provided

  Description:
  
  More button, which was previously used to expand
  a paragraph is now a link to a new side.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg09-redundancy.mp4

  Heuristic:  A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How Reproducible?:
  Hover SEE & DO -> CHRISTMAS IN GRAZ -> CHRISTMAS MARKETS -> KARMELITERPLATZ


o MM-PC-Neg10

  Title:  Complex menu structure

  Description:
  
  The Menu structure is too complicated for
  the amount of information provided at the end.
  The user has to step through multiple sub-menus to get
  any information and since backwards navigation is lacking
  as well, this makes the side difficult to navigate.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg10-complex-menu.mp4

  Heuristic:  A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How Reproducible?:
  SHOPPING from sliding menu -> SHOPPING STREETS -> HERRENGASSE -> CAFÉ SACHER SHOP GRAZ


o MM-PC-Neg11

  Title:  Misleading menu design

  Description:
  
  The menu structure on the left hand side looks like
  it can be expanded, but does not contain any 
  additional information.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg11-misleading-design.mp4

  Heuristic:  A04 Consistency

  How Reproducible?:
  *only in german language selection
    GRUPPEN -> PROGRAMMVORSCHLÄGE -> STADTFÜHRUNGEN FÜR GRUPPEN


o MM-PC-Neg12       [corresponds to MM-Mob-Neg01]

  Title:  Overlapping of buttons

  Description:
  
  The buttons for closing the map and going into fullscreen mode overlap.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg12-overlapping-buttons.mp4

  Heuristic:  A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How Reproducible?:
    SHOPPING from sliding menu -> SHOPPING STREETS -> HERRENGASSE -> CAFÉ SACHER SHOP GRAZ -> open map


o MM-PC-Neg13     [corresponds to MM-Mob-Neg10] 

  Title:  Misleading tab selection

  Description:
  
  It looks like information tab is selected, since there
  is no separator between the content and the tab name.
  When selecting the Events tab the separator stays and it
  still looks like the Information tab is selected.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-neg13-keywords.mp4

  Heuristic:  A06 Recognition Rather Than Recall

  How Reproducible?:
    SEE & DO -> SIGHTSEEING -> Top 10 Sights -> LANDHAUS COURTYARD -> select Events tab


Positive Findings
-----------------

o MM-PC-Pos01

  Title:  Search feature

  Description:

  Since the menu contains so many entries, the search feature
  is very welcome to find what you need quickly, instead of browsing
  through all the possible locations of what you are looking for.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-pos01-search.mp4

  How Reproducible?:  Click search bar -> enter search term -> hit enter


o MM-PC-Pos02

  Title:  Advent page

  Description:

  The side provides an advent themed view of graz, with suggestions
  appropriate for the time. There you can find a list of christmas markets,
  events during christmas time and a picture gallery of the christmas tree.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-pos02-advent.mp4

  How Reproducible?:
    Hover SEE & DO -> CHRISTMAS IN GRAZ


o MM-PC-Pos03

  Title:  Group suggestions

  Description:

  The side offers the option to specifically find activities for groups
  to get useful suggestions faster. It is a stripped down version of the side targeted
  at group programmes.

  Video Clip:  mm-pc-pos03-groups.mp4

  How Reproducible?:
    Groups button at the top of the page

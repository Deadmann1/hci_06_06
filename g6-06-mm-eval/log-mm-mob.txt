Negative Findings (Problems)
-----------------

o MM-Mob-Neg01    [corresponds to MM-PC-Neg12]

  Title:  Overlapping of buttons

  Description:
  
  The buttons for closing the map and going into fullscreen mode overlap.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-neg01-overlapping-buttons.mp4

  Heuristic: A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How Reproducible?:
  SHOPPING from sliding menu -> SHOPPING STREETS -> HERRENGASSE -> CAFÉ SACHER SHOP GRAZ -> open map


o MM-Mob-Neg02

  Title:  Wrong popup placement

  Description:
  
  The popup window in the map is sized/placed incorrectly,
  such that it is not entirely visible. It can be viewed entirely
  by moving the shop icon in the top left corner, but that should
  not be necessary.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-neg02-popup-placement.mp4

  Heuristic: A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How Reproducible?:
    SHOPPING from sliding menu -> SHOPPING STREETS -> HERRENGASSE -> CAFÉ SACHER SHOP GRAZ -> open map -> select shop icon


o MM-Mob-Neg03

  Title:  Unintuitive button design

  Description:
  
  The button to expand the paragraph has the design of a dropdown menu.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-neg03-unintuitive-menu.mp4

  Heuristic:  A04 Consistency

  How Reproducible?:
    SEE & DO -> Top 10 Sights -> click Details button


o MM-Mob-Neg04

  Title:  Inappropriate naming of container

  Description:
  
  The container wrapping the options to save to pdf and send by email
  is named "filters" which is very misleading.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-neg04-inappropriate-naming.mp4

  Heuristic:   A04 Consistency

  How Reproducible?:
    click on watchlist -> expand filters


o MM-Mob-Neg05

  Title:  Interactive webcam feedback

  Description:
  
  The interactive webcam does not show what directions are available,
  or where start and end of the rotation is. Combined with response delay
  on a mobile device makes this difficult to navigate.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-neg05-interactive-webcam.mp4

  Heuristic:   A01 Feedback

  How Reproducible?:
    GOOD TO KNOW -> SERVICE -> Webcam Graz -> inspect a webcam


o MM-Mob-Neg06

  Title:  Interactive webcam useless buttons

  Description:
  
  Some of the interactive webcams contain forward and backwards (in time presumably) buttons
  which do not do anything other than the pressed animation.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-neg06-interactive-webcam-buttons.mp4

  Heuristic:   A04 Consistency

  How Reproducible?:
    GOOD TO KNOW -> SERVICE -> Webcam Graz -> inspect the second webcam


o MM-Mob-Neg07

  Title:  Useless scrollbar

  Description:
  
  When any selection is made on this page, the inner box
  gets its own scrollbar, without any need for it. It only 
  makes scrolling through white space available and delays
  scrolling, while scrolling inside the box. Especially on
  mobile devices it makes for awkward navigation.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-neg07-useless-scrollbar.mp4

  Heuristic:   A07 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

  How Reproducible?:
    GOOD TO KNOW -> SERVICE -> Corona - Latest News -> Select any option


o MM-Mob-Neg08

  Title:  Button duplicate

  Description:
  
  Two search buttons exist with the same functionality. The key word input
  could be part of the filters group anyway which would also eliminate the duplicate
  search button.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-neg08-button-duplicate.mp4

  Heuristic:   A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How Reproducible?:
    SEE & DO -> EVENTS -> Event Calender -> Show filters


o MM-Mob-Neg09

  Title:  Misalignment

  Description:
  
  The text intersects with the input box.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-neg09-misalignment.mp4

  Heuristic:   A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How Reproducible?:
    SEE & DO -> EVENTS -> Event Calender -> Show filters


o MM-Mob-Neg10     [corresponds to MM-PC-Neg13]

  Title:  Misleading tab selection

  Description:
  
  It looks like information tab is selected, since there
  is no separator between the content and the tab name.
  When selecting the Events tab the separator stays and it
  still looks like the Information tab is selected.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-neg10-unclear-selection.mp4

  Heuristic:  A06 Recognition Rather Than Recall

  How Reproducible?:
    SEE & DO -> SIGHTSEEING -> Top 10 Sights -> LANDHAUS COURTYARD -> select Events tab


o MM-Mob-Neg11

  Title:  Empty option in filter menu

  Description:
  
  The filter options contains an option which is empty.
  Selecting it actually changes the search results.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-neg11-filter-empty-option.mp4

  Heuristic:  A08 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

  How Reproducible?:
    EAT & DRINK -> RESTAURANT GUIDE -> Restaurant Guide Search


Positive Findings
-----------------

o MM-PC-Pos01

  Title:  Search feature

  Description:

  Since the menu contains so many entries, the search feature
  is very welcome to find what you need quickly, instead of browsing
  through all the possible locations of what you are looking for.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-pos01-search.mp4

  How Reproducible?:  Click search bar -> enter search term -> hit enter


o MM-PC-Pos02

  Title:  Advent page

  Description:

  The side provides an advent themed view of graz, with suggestions
  appropriate for the time. There you can find a list of christmas markets,
  events during christmas time and a picture gallery of the christmas tree.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-pos02-advent.mp4

  How Reproducible?:
    Hover SEE & DO -> CHRISTMAS IN GRAZ


o MM-PC-Pos03

  Title:  Group suggestions

  Description:

  The side offers the option to specifically find activities for groups
  to get useful suggestions faster. It is a stripped down version of the side targeted
  at group programmes.

  Video Clip:  mm-mob-pos03-groups.mp4

  How Reproducible?:
    Groups button at the top of the page

<h2 id="secIntroductionHeading">1 Introduction</h2>
WIP </br>
<a href="https://www.graztourismus.at/en"> https://www.graztourismus.at/en</a> is the official tourism website of the city Graz located in Austria.</br>
The website provides a wide variety of information about different kinds of places one might want to visit in Graz.
They also provide references and links to certain websites and information a tourist might need like a booking website or where to eat.
</br></br>
Our motivation and goal for this Evaluation is to provide value for toursits and residents. In detail this means sending the finished evaluation to the toursitst department of Graz.
We hope to provide value for them so that they might consider our suggestions and found problems, so that possible toursits can spend more time enjoying our beautiful city
and not hassling around with a website. In adition the website is representing Graz in the WWW and should therefor be reliable and work as intended.
<p class="instructions">

{Short description of the web site to be evaluated and the
motivation behind the evaluation.}

<h2 id="secEvaluationMethodologyHeading">2 Evaluation Methodology</h2>

<p class="instructions">
{Describe what a HE is and how it is done. Write between 300 and 500
of your <em>own</em> words. Replace my sample text below with your
own.}
</p>

<p>
Heuristic evaluation is ...

... by Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich in 1990
[<a href="#ref-Nie1990">Nie1990</a>].
</p>

<p>
For this evaluation, the "Andrews General Usability Heuristics", shown
in Appendix <a href="#appsecHeuristics">A.1</a>, will be used. These are
based on and slightly adapted from Nielsen's revised set of ten
usability heuristics [<a href="#ref-Nie1994">Nie1994</a>].
</p>


<p class="instructions">
{Cite at least two more references of your own in this section and
include them in the References section below. Use only indirect
quotations (paraphrasing), no direct quotations. You may remove or
retain my sample reference citations as you wish.}

<section id="secUserProfiles" aria-labelledby="secUserProfilesHeading">
<h2 id="secUserProfilesHeading">3 User Profiles</h2>


<p class="instructions">
{Describe the kinds of user the site is trying to attract.}
</p>
The site is specified to deliver inforamtion to tourists of Graz. But can also be useful for residents of the City.

<p class="instructions">
{Group these users into categories according to their
characteristics.}
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Tourists:</h4>
</br>
<ol>
<li>Tourists want to get interesting spots in the city. If they already have a vague plan in their head what they want to do in Graz, they want to get specific information for that task.
  A good example would be that they want to visit Schlossberg. They know they want to visit Schlossbrer, but don't know exactly where it is and how to get onto it. Besides,
  they might be interested what they can do at Schlossberg, what Restaurants are there and how long should they plan for this trip, and what they might need to bring. This
  was described for Schlossberg, but can be applied to any other activity.</li>

<li>In addion they might be looking for interesting activitys in the City. What is in theyr vacinity and how much it costs.</li>
<li>Toursits are not just looking for fun activities just as hiking up the Schlossberg. They might want to go Shopping. They want maybe a specific shop just as Spar, but maybe also want to see what
Clothing Shops Graz has to offer and where they are.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Possible Toursits/Future Tourists:</h4>
Possible Toursits are persons that might go to Graz but are not sure if this is the right city to visit for them. </br>
Future Toursits are persons that have decided that they want to go to Graz but they might still need inforamtion.

<ol>
  <li>They might look for the classic Culture or activities that are possible in Graz. Are the Music Festival, Museums etc. They want to go onto the city and see quickly in a few clicks which activities
    might interest them.
  </li>
  <li>Good hotels are often hard to find. They want to quickly get a some good recommendation. Maybe even in theyr target area.</li>
</ol>
</br>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Residents</h4>
Altough the site is mainly targeted at Toursits. Residents can still find use out of this site.
<ol>
  <li>Finding new things to do. People living long and short in Graz might be interested in trying out new things or seeing what theyr city actually has to offer. They want to see a lot of stuff to do
    maybe in categories in only a few clicks.
  </li>
  <li>Just like 3.1.c Residents might look for good shopping possibilities in Graz.</li>
  <li>Just like in 3.2.b Residents might want to look for good Hotels for theyr friends or families that might want to visit Graz.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="instructions">
{Describe the goals and typical tasks for each of these
user groups.}

<h2 id="secExtentHeading">4 Extent of the Evaluation</h2>

<p class="instructions">
{Describe which parts of the web site will be evaluated.
Unless agreed otherwise with your tutor, assume that you
will evaluate the entire web site.}
</p>

<p>
The entire german version of the website will be evaluted including

<h2 id="secEvaluatorsHeading">5 Evaluators and Evaluation Environments</h2>

<p class="instructions">
{Tabular overviews of the different evaluators and their planned
evaluation environments: demographic data, hardware, browser, type and
speed of internet connection, etc. which each evaluator will be
using.}
</p>


<p>
Each evaluator will evaluate the web site with both a mobile web
browser and a PC web browser. Mobile devices will be operated in
portrait mode and PC web browsers in landscape mode. The evaluators
will use the mobile evaluation environments shown in
Table <a href="#table-1">1</a> and the PC evaluation environments
shown in Table <a href="#table-2">2</a>.
</p>

<p class="instructions">
{Fill out the tables as far as you can at the moment of writing the HE
Plan. Measure the download speed of your internet connection (in
Austria, use

<p class="instructions">
{For each device/platform, explain the software and encoder settings
which will be used to make the session recordings.  Replace my sample
text below with your own.}
</p>

<p>
On Windows, all evaluators will try to use OBS Studio
to make screen recordings with audio commentary.
The following video encoder settings have been tested but might be subject to change: 
Container: MP4,
Output Video Resolution: 1920x1080,
Frame Rate: 20fps,
Codec: H.264,
Rate Control: VBR,
Bit Rate: 5000kbps</p>

<p>The following audio encoder settings have been tested but might be subject to change:
Channels: Stereo,
Codec: AAC,
Sample Rate 44100Hz,
Bit Rate: 160 kbps,
Bits per Sample: 32</p>


<p>
Evaluators that use AZ-Screen Recorder with the mobile evaluation will try to replicate the settings on the PC
,but not all options, such as Audio Settings are modifiable.
</p>
<p>
In abberation from above settings Marius will use because of enviroment limitations on the iPad the following settings: 
Resolution 1440x1920,
Bitrate: 19040kbit/s,
Frame Rate: 34</p>



<p class="instructions">
{Explain how you will edit/cut/extract the video clips from your
screen recordings. Replace my sample text below with your own.}
</p>

<p>
On Windows we will use the OpenShot Video Editor to edit and extract the video clips.
Mobile Clips will be transfered to a PC and then cut there.
</p>



<p class="instructions">
{Explain how you will transcode your video clips to a lower resolution
or another video format, should it be necessary. Replace my sample
text below with your own.}
</p>

<p>
Since the iPad 10.2" 8th Generation has a native resolution larger than FullHD. A 
other screen capture format can not be choosen than the native one, therefor
evaluation video clips will be moved to a Windows 10 pc and then 
transcoded from 2160x1620 to 1440x1080 in addition with the resolution change there will be an adaption
to the standard video and audio settings stated above.

The AZ Screen Recorder automatically can record in 1080p so transcodding the video clips from higher resolution is not necessary on Android Devices.
